# Hello-world
My name is Arianne McDonald
Let me be real, as a math majr we are required to take computer science and I've taken it 3 times and each time my professors made me absoluteky hate it. 
I swore off coding and said I would never (spoiler, I lied)
One day I deciced, let me learn this on my own.
I took the python and AI with python course at Harvard and absolutely fell in love with coding.
As a girl who's a minority from the bronx, I plan to make it out of the bronx and go into the city!!
I am an aspiring software engineer and I will do, watch me ;)
