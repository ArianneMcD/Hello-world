# Hello-world

My name is Arianne McDonald
Let me be real! As math majors, we are required to take computer science.
I've taken it 3 times and each time my professors made me absolutely hate it. 
I swore off coding and said I would never code AGAIN!!! (spoiler, I lied lol)
One day I deciced, let me learn this on my own.
I took the python and AI with python course at Harvard University and absolutely fell in love with coding.
As a girl who's a minority from the bronx, I plan to make it out of the bronx and go into the theee Manahatten!!
I am an aspiring software engineer and I will do it, I will make it,... watch me ;)
